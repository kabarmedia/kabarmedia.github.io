<p><strong>Lamarck Vs Darwin</strong>. Darwin and Lamarck also agreed that life evolved from fewer simpler organisms to many more complex organisms. The first is by experiment. While Lamarck was known for his theory of inheritance by acquired characteristics Darwin was also respectfully known for his theory of evolution by natural selection.

Darwin and Lamarck both used the same evidence for creating theory of evolution such as vestigial structures and artificial selection through breeding but both naturalist Darwin and Lamarck came up with different arguments. Lamarck believed that evolution happens according to a prearranged plan and that the results. In the fourth law of the framework Lamarck explained the concept of inheritance. Though both of the theorists have proposed that living beings are evolving throughout the years a. Start studying Lamarck and Darwin theories comparison.</p>
